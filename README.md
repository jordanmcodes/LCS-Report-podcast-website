## Website design using wireframes
This website will be a simple yet effective website for my LCS Report podcast. This will give our audience a place to see all of our content under one roof. 

## Navigation bar + structured layout
The website will follow a simple three button navigation bar. This navigation bar will appear at the top of every page on the website, each button will link to the deisred page you want to access. 

Each page will follow a simple layout that the audience can clearly navigate through without any difficulty. Here is how each page is structured. 

**Home page**: The homepage will have the heading at the top of the page underneath the navigation bar, followed by an introduction piece of text, welcoming the viewers to the webiste. Followed by the featured image below, this will be our most recent episode so you're never out of the loop.

**Podcast page** : This will be where the bulk of the content is displayed. Again below the navigation bar there will be a heading and an introduction block of text that will go over the page and explain about how this page will be updated in a timely fashion to accomodate the new episodes on the page.

Each episode will have an image that is hyperlinked to the podcast episode with a heading of the episode and a description next to it. 

**Contact us page**: This page is where the fans will get to contact the podcast to ask any burning questions, podcast feedback, and more. Below the navigation bar will be the headong asking them to please get in touch, with more information on when we can answer questions, what is allowed to be asked, and more. This is followed by a form with a simple email, twitter handle, and comment form.
Here is how each page will playout:

**Home**: 
- h1: LCS Report Podcast
- p: introduction text
- video:featured video block


**Podcast**
- h1: Our Latest Episodes!
- p : introduction text
- img:three image blocks that are hyperlinked to external pages.

Having the navigation bar in the same position helps the design remain consistent, making the website accessible for its users as the position of the navigation bar and its buttons will be in the same place.
