    <h1> Our Latest Episodes!</h1>
    <p>This is where the heart of the LCS Report lives! Below you can view our most recent episodes, including our livestreams from the 2025 League of Legends World Championship. A cool fact about Worlds is that we livestreamed every day for a month straight! That's 31 episodes in the space of a month, which was a very big achievement for us. This page will be updated weekly as new episodes are recorded. Please like, subscribe, and enjoy!</p>
