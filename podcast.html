    <p class="episode-1-text">In this episode Cloud and Marn goes over Gen.G's devistating performance at Worlds 2025. How can they recover from this? We also go into depth on KT Rolster making history at Worlds. A team that we did not predict to go far at this tournament, and suddenly, they have the summoners cup in their eyes! This is turning out to being an amazing tournament</p>

    <p class="episode-2-text">In this episode, Cloud and Marn go over the devistating civil war that is going on between the Fnatic players and coaches following their exit from Worlds 2025. It wasn't even 24 hours and the coach was already calling out the players for their desire to win. Every Worlds, there is a team that can't deal with the pressure, this is the case with Fnatic where they were not able to put together a strong performance</p>

    <p class="episode-3-text">This may have been one of the craziest days of Worlds in many years! Firstly you had KT absolutely destroying TOP Esports to go 3-0 in the Swiss stage. Who would have thought at the start of the tournament that KT would be the team that goes undefeated? Then you had CFO vs AL which was an all-time classic. Simply amazing to watch both of these teams play</p>
